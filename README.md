# Hello This is Mustapha ðŸ‘‹ #
### I'm not a professional programmer but I do webdev as a side hobby. I work mostly with web technologies, enhanced by [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to build web apps that sometimes only I use.  ###


âš¡ Fun fact: I was trained as a Designer in college, but I've been programming since age 10 (a loooong time ago)... This makes me technically a full stack webdev because I work on design, backend and frontend.
